# Hello World Solidity Smart Contract

Sure, here's an example README for a "Hello World" smart contract in Solidity:

## Description

This is a simple "Hello World" smart contract written in Solidity. It demonstrates the basic structure and functionality of a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Requirements

To run this smart contract, you'll need the following:

- An Ethereum wallet
- An Ethereum client (such as [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) or [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/))
- Solidity compiler (such as [solc](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing-solidity.html))

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the Solidity compiler according to the documentation.
3. Open the Solidity file `HelloWorld.sol` in your preferred development environment.
4. Compile the smart contract using the Solidity compiler.
5. Deploy the compiled smart contract to your Ethereum client.

## Usage

1. Call the `getMessage()` function to retrieve the "Hello World" message.
2. Call the `setMessage(string memory newMessage)` function to change the message to your preferred string.
