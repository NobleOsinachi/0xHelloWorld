# Solidity Smart Contract Learning Journey

Welcome to my Solidity learning repository! This is where I'll be documenting my progress as I learn Solidity.
By using commits to track my progress, I'll be able to look back at my journey and see how far I've come.
This started as a simple "Hello World" smart contract written in Solidity, which I used to demonstrate the basic structure and functionality of a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. It also simulates deployment procedure using Remix IDE's deployment on the GOERLI testnet.

Over time, it now contains a collection of Solidity code snippets that can be used as a starting point for building decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum blockchain. 

For those thinking, "What is Solidity? Another state of matter?", Lol! it is a programming language used for writing smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

## What I Expect to Gain

I expect to gain a deep understanding of Solidity by documenting my progress via commits. By updating my code regularly via commits and pull requests, I'll be able to see how my code has evolved over time and identify areas where I need to improve.

In addition to gaining technical skills, I also expect to gain a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction as I make progress in my Solidity learning journey. By documenting my progress and sharing it with others, I hope to inspire and motivate others who are also learning Solidity.

## How to Use This Repo

Personally, I use [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org) for writing small codebases. 

If you'll be using VS Code, to get started with Solidity, you'll need to install a Solidity compiler. The recommended compiler version for this repository is Solidity 0.8.0 or higher. You can find installation instructions for the Solidity compiler on [the official Solidity website.](https://docs.soliditylang.org/)

This repo is organized by topics and concepts that I'm learning. Each topic has a corresponding folder, and within each folder, I'll be committing my code as I learn. You can browse the commits to see how my code has evolved over time, and you can also use the code as a reference or starting point for your own Solidity projects.

The code snippets in this repository cover some of the basic concepts of Solidity, including:

* Variables and data types
* Functions
* Control structures (if/else, for/while loops)
* Arrays and mappings
* Events and modifiers
* Inheritance and interfaces
* Error handling

## Requirements

To run this smart contract, you'll need the following:

- Metamask Browser Extension
- An Ethereum wallet
- An Ethereum client (such as [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) or [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) )
- Solidity compiler (such as [solc](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing-solidity.html))

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the Solidity compiler according to the documentation.
3. Open the Solidity file `HelloWorld.sol` located in the `contracts` directory in your preferred development environment.
4. Compile the smart contract using the Solidity compiler.
5. Deploy the compiled smart contract to your Ethereum client.

## Usage

1. Call the `getMessage()` function to retrieve the "Hello World" message.
2. Call the `setMessage(string memory newMessage)` function to change the message to your preferred string.
